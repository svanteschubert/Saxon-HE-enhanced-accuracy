/**
 * This interface describes the execute immediate functionality for
 * expressions. This object can be created from the <code>XQConnection</code>
 * and the execution can be done using the <code>executeQuery()</code> or
 * <code>executeCommand()</code> method, passing in the XQuery expression. <p>
 * <p/>
 * All external variables defined in the prolog of the expression to be executed must
 * be set in the dynamic context of this expression using the bind methods.
 * Also, variables bound in this expression but not defined as external in
 * the prolog of the expression to be executed, are simply ignored.
 * For example, if variables <code>$var1</code> and <code>$var2</code> are bound,
 * but the query only defines <code>$var1</code> as external, no error
 * will be reported for the binding of <code>$var2</code>. It will simply
 * be ignored.
 * <p/>
 * When the expression is executed using the <code>executeQuery</code>
 * method, if the execution is successful, then
 * an <code>XQResultSequence</code> object is returned.
 * The <code>XQResultSequence</code> object is tied to
 * the <code>XQExpression</code> from which it was prepared and is
 * closed implicitly if that <code>XQExpression</code> is either closed or re-executed.  <p>
 * <p/>
 * The <code>XQExpression</code> object is dependent on
 * the <code>XQConnection</code> object from which it was created and is only
 * valid for the duration of that object.
 * Thus, if the <code>XQConnection</code> object is closed then
 * this <code>XQExpression</code> object  will be implicitly closed
 * and it can no longer be used. <p>
 * <p/>
 * An XQJ driver is not required to provide finalizer methods for
 * the connection and other objects. Hence it is strongly recommended that
 * users call close method explicitly to free any resources. It is also
 * recommended that they do so under a final block to ensure that the object
 * is closed even when there are exceptions. Not closing this object implicitly
 * or explicitly might result in serious memory leaks. <p>
 * <p/>
 * When the <code>XQExpression</code> is closed any <code>XQResultSequence</code>
 * object obtained from it is also implicitly closed. <p>
 * <p/>
 * Example -
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *  XQConnection conn = XQDatasource.getConnection();
 *  XQExpression expr = conn.createExpression();
 *
 *  expr.bindInt(new QName("x"), 21, null);
 *
 *  XQSequence result = expr.executeQuery(
 *     "declare variable $x as xs:integer external;
 *     for $i in $x return $i");
 *
 *  while (result.next())
 *  {
 *     // process results ...
 *  }
 *
 *  // Execute some other expression on the same object
 *  XQSequence result = expr.executeQuery("for $i in doc('foo.xml') return $i");
 *  ...
 *
 *  result.close(); // close the result
 *  expr.close();
 *  conn.close();
 * </pre>
