 * The <code>XQConnectionEventListener</code> interface is implemented by a
 * connection pooling component.  A connection pooling component will
 * usually be provided by an XQJ vendor or by another system software
 * vendor.  An XQJ implementation notifies an <code>XQConnectionEventListener</code>
 * object when an application is finished using a pooled connection with
 * which the listener has registered.  The notification
 * occurs after the application calls the method <code>close</code> on
 * its representation of a <code>PooledXQConnection</code> object.  An
 * <code>XQConnectionEventListener</code> is also notified when a
 * connection error occurs due to the fact that the <code>PooledXQConnection</code>
 * is unfit for future use - the network connection to the XML datasource died, for example.
 * The listener is notified by the XQJ implementation just before it throws an
 * <code>XQException</code> to the application using the
 * <code>PooledXQConnection</code> object.
