<p>This package defines implementations and subinterfaces of the interface SequenceIterator, which is
    used to iterate over an XDM sequence.</p>

<p>The subinterfaces mostly represent iterators with additional capability: for example a LastPositionFinder
    can determine the number of items in the sequence without reading to the end; a GroundedIterator can deliver
    the original sequence as a list in memory; a LookaheadIterator is capable of one-item look-ahead. Note
    that just because a class implements such an interface does not mean it necessarily has this capability;
    it is necessary to check the properties of the specific iterator before assuming this.</p>
