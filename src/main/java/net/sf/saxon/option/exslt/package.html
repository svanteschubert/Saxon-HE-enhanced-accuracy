    <title>Package overview for net.sf.saxon.exslt</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides implementations of the functions defined in <a href="http://www.exslt.org">EXSLT</a>.</p>

<p>The implementation of EXSLT functions is by no means complete (the specifications in many cases were never finally finished),
    but the major functions are provided - even where they are effectively superseded by functions available
    in XPath 2.0.</p>
