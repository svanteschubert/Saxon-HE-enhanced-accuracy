/**
 * An XsltCompiler object allows XSLT 2.0 and XSLT 3.0 stylesheets to be compiled. The compiler holds information that
 * represents the static context for the compilation.
 * <p>To construct an {@code XsltCompiler}, use the factory method {@link Processor#newXsltCompiler} on the Processor object.</p>
 * <p>An {@code XsltCompiler} may be used repeatedly to compile multiple queries. Any changes made to the
 * {@code XsltCompiler} (that is, to the static context) do not affect queries that have already been compiled.
 * An XsltCompiler may in principle be used concurrently in multiple threads, but in practice this
 * is best avoided because all instances will share the same ErrorListener and it may therefore be
 * difficult to establish which error messages are associated with each compilation.</p>
 * <p>If JIT compilation is enabled (this is the default for Saxon-EE), then static errors in template
 *  rules might be detected not during execution of the <code>compile()</code> method, but rather
 *  when the relevant code is first executed. In this situation the <code>compile()</code> method will
 *  not throw an exception, but the errors will still (eventually) be notified to the <code>ErrorListener</code>
 *  associated with the compiler.</p>
 *  <p>To avoid problems with error reporting, it is recommended that:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>When code is under development and static errors are therefore likely, a new
 *      {@code XsltCompiler} should be created for each compilation (and JIT should preferably
 *      be disabled, so that all static errors are detected.)</li>
 *      <li>When production code is being loaded, and errors are therefore unlikely,
 *      it is safe to use the same {@code XsltCompiler} for all compilations, and to
 *      enable JIT for maximum performance.</li>
 *  </ul>
