<p>This package contains the code to map XML Schema and XPath regular expressions
    to a regular expression engine of the underlying Java platform.</p>

<p>Most of the classes implement a regular expression engine derived from Apache's Jakarta
    project. The code of Jakarta has been modified so that the regular expressions implement
    the syntax of XSD/XPath regular expressions. There have also been extensive changes
    for performance reasons</p>

<p>In addition, there are classes to provide direct access to the native JDK
    regular expression engine. The flags value ";j" may be used to select this
    engine. The resulting syntax/semantics will not be an exact match to the XPath
    definition.</p>

<p>Users should not normally need to use these classes directly.</p>

<p>Earlier versions of Saxon included a translator from XPath regular expressions
    to Java regular expressions, based on that produced by James Clark. This
    mechanism is no longer used.</p>
