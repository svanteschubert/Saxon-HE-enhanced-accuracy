/**
 * A <tt>SchemaValidator</tt> is an object that is used for validating instance documents against a schema.
 * The schema consists of the collection of schema components that are available within the schema
 * cache maintained by the SchemaManager, together with any additional schema components located
 * during the course of validation by means of an xsl:schemaLocation or xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation
 * attribute within the instance document.
 * <p>If validation fails, an exception is thrown. If validation succeeds, the validated document
 * can optionally be written to a specified destination. This will be a copy of the original document,
 * augmented with default values for absent elements and attributes, and carrying type annotations
 * derived from the schema processing. Expansion of defaults can be suppressed by means of the method
 * {@link #setExpandAttributeDefaults(boolean)}.</p>
 * <p>A <tt>SchemaValidator</tt> is serially reusable but not thread-safe. That is, it should normally
 * be used in the thread where it is created, but it can be used more than once, to validate multiple
 * input documents.</p>
 * <p>A <tt>SchemaValidator</tt> is a <tt>Destination</tt>, which allows it to receive the output of a
 * query or transformation to be validated.</p>
 * <p>Saxon does not deliver the full PSVI as described in the XML schema specifications,
 * only the subset of the PSVI properties featured in the XDM data model.</p>
