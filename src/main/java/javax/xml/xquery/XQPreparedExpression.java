/**
 * This interface describes an expression that can be prepared for multiple
 * subsequent executions. A prepared expression can be created from the
 * connection. <p>
 * The preparation of the expression does the static analysis of the expression
 * using the static context information. <p>
 * <p/>
 * The dynamic context information, such as values for bind variables, can then
 * be set using the setter methods. When setting values for bind variables,
 * these  variables should be present as external
 * variables in the prolog of the prepared expression.<p>
 * <p/>
 * The static type information of the query can also be retrieved if the XQuery
 * implementation provides it using the <code>getStaticResultType</code>
 * method.<p>
 * <p/>
 * When the expression is executed using the <code>executeQuery</code>
 * method, if the execution is successful, then
 * an <code>XQResultSequence</code> object is returned.
 * The <code>XQResultSequence</code> object is tied to
 * the <code>XQPreparedExpression</code> from which it was prepared and is
 * closed implicitly if that  expression is either closed or if re-executed.  <p>
 * <p/>
 * The <code>XQPreparedExpression</code> object is dependent on
 * the <code>XQConnection</code> object from which it was created and is only
 * valid for the duration of that object.
 * Thus, if the <code>XQConnection</code> object is closed then
 * this <code>XQPreparedExpression</code> object  will be implicitly closed
 * and it can no longer be used.<p>
 * <p/>
 * An XQJ driver is not required to provide finalizer methods for
 * the connection and other objects. Hence it is strongly recommended that
 * users call close method explicitly to free any resources. It is also
 * recommended that they do so under a final block to ensure that the object
 * is closed even when there are exceptions.
 * Not closing this object implicitly or explicitly might result in serious memory
 * leaks.<p>
 * <p/>
 * When the <code>XQPreparedExpression</code> is closed any
 * <code>XQResultSequence</code> object obtained from it
 * is also implicitly closed. <p>
 * <p/>
 * Example -
 * <pre>
 *  XQConnection conn = XQDataSource.getconnection();
 *  XQPreparedExpression expr = conn.prepareExpression
 *          ("for $i in (1) return 'abc' ");
 *
 *  // get the sequence type out.. This would be something like xs:string *
 *  XQSequenceType type = expr.getStaticResultType();
 *
 *  XQSequence result1 = expr.executeQuery();
 *
 *  // process the result..
 *  result1.next();
 *  System.out.println(" First result1 "+ result1.getAtomicValue());
 *
 *  XQResultSequence result2 = expr.executeQuery();
 *
 *  // result1 is implicitly closed
 *  // recommended to close the result sequences explicitly.
 *
 *  // process the result..
 *  while (result2.next())
 *     System.out.println(" result is "+ result2.getAtomicValue());
 *
 *  result2.close();
 *  expr.close(); // closing expression implicitly closes all result sequence or
 *                // items obtained from this expression.
 *  conn.close(); // closing connections will close expressions and results.
 * </pre>
