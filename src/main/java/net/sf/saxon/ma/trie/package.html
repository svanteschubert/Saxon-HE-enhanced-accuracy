<body>
<p>This package contains a general-purpose implementation of immutable hash trie maps,
used to underpin the Saxon implementation of XSLT 3.0 maps.</p>

<p>The implementation was written by Michael S. Froh (msfroh) and released under an MIT license.
It was forked from github project msfroh/functional_snippets on 28 March 2014. Very little code
has been changed during the integration with Saxon, but a great deal of un-needed code has been
removed. In addition, it has been retrofitted from Java 7 to Java 5.</p>

<p>The code betrays Scala origins in the use of classes such as Option, which is a class that
provided a type-safe way of handling null values, and Tuple2 which can hold any pair of values.</p>
