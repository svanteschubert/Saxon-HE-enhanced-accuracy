    <title>Package overview for net.sf.saxon.trace</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides an interface to Saxon tracing and debugging capabilities.</p>

<p>The package was originally created by Edwin Glaser.</p>

<p>The package includes three tracing modules that can be optionally selected:
    <code>XSLTTraceListener</code>, <code>XQueryTraceListener</code>, and
    <code>TimedTraceListener</code>. These all receive notification of the same events,
    but select and format the events in different ways to meet different requirements.
    Other events are notified through the <code>TraceListener</code> interface that
    are ignored by tracing applications, but may be of interest to debuggers.</p>
