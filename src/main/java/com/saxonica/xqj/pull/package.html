<body>

<p>This package extends the pull API for Saxon that is provided in package {@link net.sf.saxon.pull} in Saxon-HE.
    It provides features allowing
    walking of an existing Saxon tree and delivering events in the same way as a pull parser; it also allows
    queries and stylesheets to create lazily-constructed document and element nodes which can then be read
    using the pull interface.</p>

<p>The three main kinds of <code>PullProvider</code> supported in this package are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>StaxBridge, which is an interface to a pull-mode XML parser, and is also present in Saxon-HE</p></li>

    <li><p>TreeWalker, which delivers events based on an in-memory tree. There is one
        general-purpose TreeWalker that can handle any Saxon tree (any tree that implements the NodeInfo interface)
        and aother that is optimized to the TinyTree implementation.</p></li>

    <li><p>VirtualTreeWalker, which delivers events representing the nodes constructed by a
        stylesheet or query, without actually constructing the nodes in memory.
        (Note that this doesn't currently work if the constructed nodes need to be schema-validated).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The facility to evaluate the results of a query in pull mode using the <code>PullProvider</code>
    interface are largely superseded by the <code>net.sf.saxon.evpull.EventIterator</code> interface, which
    is directly or indirectly supported by all expressions.</p>

<p>Some examples of application code using the pull interface with Saxon are provided in the
    <code>PullExamples.java</code> file in the samples directory.</p>
