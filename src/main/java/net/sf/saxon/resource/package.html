</head>
<body>
<p>This package contains Java classes used to represent abstractions of resources of different
    kinds that can be retrieved as part of a collection (using the <code>fn:collection()</code> function).</p>

<p>This framework was introduced in Saxon 9.8, reflecting the change in specification of <code>fn:collection()</code>
to allow any kind of resources to be returned, not only XML documents.</p>

<p>The set of media types that are recognized, and the way in which they are processed, can be customized via the
Saxon Configuration file.</p>
