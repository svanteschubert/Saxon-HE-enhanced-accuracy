/**
 * An object that provides hooks for connection pool management.
 * A <code>PooledXQConnection</code> object
 * represents a physical connection to a data source.  The connection
 * can be recycled rather than being closed when an application is
 * finished with it, thus reducing the number of connections that
 * need to be made.
 * <p/>
 * An application programmer does not use the <code>PooledXQConnection</code>
 * interface directly; rather, it is used by a middle tier infrastructure
 * that manages the pooling of connections.
 * <p/>
 * When an application calls the method <code>XQDataSource.getConnection</code>,
 * it gets back an <code>XQConnection</code> object.  If connection pooling is
 * being done, that <code>XQConnection</code> object is actually a handle to
 * a <code>PooledXQConnection</code> object, which is a physical connection.
 * <p/>
 * The connection pool manager, typically the application server, maintains
 * a pool of <code>PooledXQConnection</code> objects.  If there is a
 * <code>PooledXQConnection</code> object available in the pool, the
 * connection pool manager returns an <code>XQConnection</code> object that
 * is a handle to that physical connection.
 * If no <code>PooledXQConnection</code> object is available, the
 * connection pool manager calls the <code>ConnectionPoolXQDataSource</code>
 * method <code>getPooledConnection</code> to create a new physical connection and
 * returns a handle to it.
 * <p/>
 * When an application closes a connection, it calls the <code>XQConnection</code>
 * method <code>close</code>. When connection pooling is being done,
 * the connection pool manager is notified because it has registered itself as
 * an <code>XQConnectionEventListener</code> object using the
 * <code>PooledXQConnection</code> method <code>addConnectionEventListener</code>.
 * The connection pool manager deactivates the handle to
 * the <code>PooledXQConnection</code> object and returns the
 * <code>PooledXQConnection</code> object to the pool of connections so that
 * it can be used again.  Thus, when an application closes its connection,
 * the underlying physical connection is recycled rather than being closed.
 * <p/>
 * The physical connection is not closed until the connection pool manager
 * calls the <code>PooledXQConnection</code> method <code>close</code>.
 * This method is generally called to have an orderly shutdown of the server or
 * if a fatal error has made the physical connection unusable.
