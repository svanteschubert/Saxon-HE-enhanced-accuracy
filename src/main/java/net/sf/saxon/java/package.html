</head>
<body>
<p>This package contains Saxon code that is specific to the Java platform, as distinct from .NET</p>

<p>The areas where Saxon has different implementations for the two platforms are primarily
    URI handling, interfaces to XML parsers, regular expression handling, and use of collations.</p>

<p>Access to these classes is generally via the <code>Platform</code> object, of which the
    implementation for the Java platform is named <code>JavaPlatform</code>. This is obtained in turn
    via the static method <code>Version.platform</code></p>
