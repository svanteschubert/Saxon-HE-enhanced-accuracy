    <title>Package overview for net.sf.saxon.functions</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides implementations of all the core functions available for use
    in XPath expressions. This includes all the functions defined in the XPath 2.0
    <i>Functions and Operators</i> specification, as well as the additional functions
    defined for use in XSLT. The package also includes Saxon extension functions. Most
    of these are in a single class <code>Extensions</code>, but some of the more
    complex functions are in their own classes, for example <code>Evaluate</code> implements
    <code>saxon:evaluate()</code>.</p>

<p>There is one class for group of closely-related functions. These all inherit from the class
    net.sf.saxon.expr.Function. The class <code>StandardFunction</code> is used to map a function
    name to its implementation; it contains tables of information describing the signature of each
    function, so that the type-checking code is completely generic.</p>

<p>The package also contains machinery for defining user extension functions. A collection
    of functions is represented by a <code>FunctionLibrary</code> object. There are several
    standard function libraries available, covering core functions, Saxon extension functions
    constructor functions, and user extension functions: each category is covered by a subclass
    of <code>FunctionLibrary</code>, and there is also a <code>FunctionLibraryList</code> that
    represents the total collection of functions in these individual libraries. The
    <code>JavaExtensionLibrary</code> contains the logic for binding Java extension functions
    given their name and arity and the types of their arguments. The class <code>ExtensionFunctionCall</code>
    contains the run-time logic for converting XPath values to the required Java types, and for converting
    the result back to an XPath value.</p>

<p>These classes, although public, will not normally be used directly by user-written
    Java applications. There are a few exceptions, such as <code>ResolveURI</code> which deliberately
expose functionality equivalent to the XPath function in a static method.</p>
