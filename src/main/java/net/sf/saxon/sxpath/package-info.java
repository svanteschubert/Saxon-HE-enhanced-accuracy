/**
 * <p>This package originally provided an alternative API for executing XPath expressions

 * <p>The preferred API for executing XPath expressions in Saxon is the <code>s9api</code>
 * package. This package is older, and provides a lower-level interface that offers access to more
 * internal details, but is not so convenient to use.</p>
