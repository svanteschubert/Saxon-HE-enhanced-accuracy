    <title>Package overview for net.sf.saxon.sxpath</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package originally provided an alternative API for executing XPath expressions
    directly from a Java application. It is no longer recommended for application use,
    but is still used internally to underpin the public JAXP and s9api APIs.</p>

<p>The preferred API for executing XPath expressions in Saxon is the <code>s9api</code>
    package. This package is older, and provides a lower-level interface that offers access to more
    internal details, but is not so convenient to use.</p>
