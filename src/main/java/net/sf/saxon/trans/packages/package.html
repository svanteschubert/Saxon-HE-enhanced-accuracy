<body>
<p>This package contains classes used to support creation of XSLT 3.0 packages. Note that
creation of packages is specific to Saxon-EE, but such packages can in general be loaded
and executed by Saxon-HE or Saxon-PE.</p>

<p>None of these classes will be used by typical user applications.</p>
