 * <p>This framework was introduced in Saxon 9.8, reflecting the change in specification of <code>fn:collection()</code>
 * to allow any kind of resources to be returned, not only XML documents.</p>
 * <p>The set of media types that are recognized, and the way in which they are processed, can be customized via the
 * Saxon Configuration file.</p>
