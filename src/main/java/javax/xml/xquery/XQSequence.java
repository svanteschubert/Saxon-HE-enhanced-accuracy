/**
 * This interface represents a sequence of items as defined in the
 * XDM. The sequence may be materialized or non-materialized. <p>
 * <p/>
 * The <code>next</code> method is useful to position the
 * <code>XQSequence</code> over the next item in the sequence.
 * If the scrollability is <code>XQConstants.SCROLLTYPE_SCROLLABLE</code>,
 * then the <code>previous</code> method can be called to move backwards.
 * <p/>
 * In the case of a forward only sequence, the get methods may be only called
 * once per item. To perform multiple gets on an item, extract the item first
 * from the sequence using the <code>getItem</code> method and
 * then operate on the <code>XQItem</code> object.
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *
 *  XQPreparedExpression expr = conn.prepareExpression("for $i ..");
 *  XQSequence result = expr.executeQuery();
 *
 *  // create the ItemTypes for string and integer
 *  XQItemType strType = conn.createAtomicType(XQItemType.XQBASETYPE_STRING);
 *  XQItemType intType = conn.createAtomicType(XQItemType.XQBASETYPE_INT);
 *
 *  // positioned before the first item
 *  while (result.next())
 *  {
 *    XQItemType type = result.getItemType();
 *
 *    // If string, then get the string value out
 *    if (type.equals(strType))
 *      String str = result.getAtomicValue();
 *    else if (type.equals(intType))  // if it is an integer..
 *      int intval = result.getInt();
 *
 *     ...
 *  }
 *
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * In a sequence, the cursor may be positioned on an item, after the last item
 * or before the first item. The <code>getPosition</code> method
 * returns the current position number. A value of 0 indicates
 * that it is  positioned before the first item, a value of <code>count() + 1</code>
 * indicates that it is positioned after the last item, and any other value
 * indicates that it is positioned on the item at that position.  <p>
 * For example, a position value of 1 indicates that it is positioned on
 * the item at position 1. <p>
 * <p/>
 * The <code>isOnItem</code> method may be used to find out if the cursor
 * is positioned on the item. When the cursor is positioned on an item,
 * the <code>next</code> method call will move the cursor to be on the next item.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * See also: <i>Section 12 Serialization, XQuery API for Java
 * (XQJ) 1.0</i>,  which describes some general information applicable
 * to various XQJ serialization methods.
