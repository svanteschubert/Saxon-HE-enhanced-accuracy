/**
 * A connection (session) with a specific XQuery engine. Connections are
 * obtained through an <code>XQDataSource</code> object.
 * <p/>
 * XQuery expressions are executed and results are returned within the
 * context of a connection. They are either executed through <code>XQExpression</code>
 * or <code>XQPreparedExpression</code> objects. <p>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *  XQDataSource ds;// obtain the XQuery datasource
 *  ...
 *  XQConnection conn = ds.getConnection();
 *
 *  XQPreparedExpression expr = conn.prepareExpression("for $i in ...");
 *  XQResultSequence result = expr.executeQuery();
 *  // - or -
 *  XQExpression expr = conn.createExpression();
 *  XQSequence result = expr.executeQuery("for $i in..");
 *
 *  // The sequence can now be iterated
 *  while (result.next())
 *  {
 *     String str  = result.getItemAsString();
 *     System.out.println(" output "+ str);
 *  }
 *  result.close();
 *  expr.close();
 *  conn.close();  // close the connection and free all resources..
 *
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * A connection holds also default values for <code>XQExpression</code> and
 * <code>XQPreparedExpression</code> properties. An application can
 * override these defaults by passing an <code>XQStaticContext</code>
 * object to the <code>setStaticContext()</code> method.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * By default a connection operates in auto-commit mode, which means that
 * each xquery is executed and committed in an individual transaction. If
 * auto-commit mode is disabled, a transaction must be ended explicitly by
 * the application calling <code>commit()</code> or
 * <code>rollback()</code>.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * An <code>XQConnection</code> object can be created on top of an
 * existing JDBC connection. If an <code>XQConnection</code> is
 * created on top of the JDBC connection, it inherits the transaction context
 * from the JDBC connection. Also, in this case, if the auto-commit mode is
 * changed, or a transaction is ended using commit or rollback,
 * it also changes the underlying JDBC connection.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * An XQJ driver is not required to provide finalizer methods for
 * the connection and other objects. Hence it is strongly recommended that
 * users call close method explicitly to free any resources. It is also
 * recommended that they do so under a final block to ensure that the object
 * is closed even when there are exceptions. Not closing this object explicitly
 * might result in serious memory leaks. <p>
 * <p/>
 * When the <code>XQConnection</code> is closed any <code>XQExpression</code>
 * and <code>XQPreparedExpression</code> objects obtained from it are also
 * implicitly closed. <p>
